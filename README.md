# Advent of Code 2024

Welcome to my solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024)! This repository contains solutions written in **Go**.

## ðŸŽ„ About Advent of Code
Advent of Code is an annual coding event where participants solve daily programming puzzles during the month of December. Each day provides a new challenge, ranging in difficulty, often requiring creative problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Go: Ensure you have Go installed. You can download it from golang.org.
- Git: Clone the repository using Git.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/licorice-vector/advent-of-code-2024.git
   cd advent-of-code-2024
   ```

2. Install dependencies (if any):
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

### Running a Solution
Each day's solution is in its own directory under ./days/dayXX/. To run a solution:
   ```bash
   go run days/day01/solution.go days/day01/main.go
   ```

### Testing
To run the tests for a specific day:
   ```bash
   go test ./days/day01/
   ```

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries
- Go: The primary programming language.
- VS Code: Recommended editor with Go extensions for debugging and linting.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Solve all 25 puzzles (or as many as possible).
- Write clean, maintainable, and efficient Go code.
- Explore new algorithms and data structures.

## ðŸ“… Progress
| Day  | Part 1 | Part 2 |
